# ðŸ¤– Embedded-AI

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on running **machine learning models on microcontrollers** and **embedded systems**.

Each subfolder demonstrates a specific TinyML or embedded AI project â€” from model training to deployment on hardware like **Arduino**, **ESP32**, and other low-power boards.

These projects showcase how powerful AI can run locally, **without cloud or internet**, enabling real-time decision-making directly on the device.
